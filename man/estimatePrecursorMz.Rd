\title{Estimating precursor m/z valus for DDA data}
\usage{
estimatePrecursorMz(object, tolerance = 0.3, ppm = 10, BPPARAM = SerialParam())
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{\link[=Spectra]{Spectra()}} object with \strong{DDA} data.}

\item{tolerance}{\code{numeric(1)} defining an absolute acceptable difference in
m/z between the fragment spectra's reported precursor m/z and the
MS1 peaks considered as the precursor peak. All MS1 peaks from the
previous MS1 scan with an m/z between the fragment spectrum's
precursorMz +/- (tolerance + ppm(precursorMz, ppm)) are considered.}

\item{ppm}{\code{numeric(1)} defining the m/z dependent acceptable difference in
m/z. See documentation of parameter \code{tolerance} for more information.}

\item{BPPARAM}{parallel processing setup. Defaults to
\code{BPPARAM = SerialParam()}. See \code{\link[=SerialParam]{SerialParam()}} for more information.}
}
\value{
\code{numeric} of length equal to the number of spectra in \code{object} with
the fragment spectra's estimated precursor m/z values. For MS1 spectra
\code{NA_real_} values are returned. The original precursor m/z is reported
for MS2 spectra for which no matching MS1 peak was found.
}
\description{
MS data from Waters instruments are calibrated through the \emph{Lock Mass}, but,
while all m/z values of mass peaks in each spectrum will be calibrated by
this method, the reported precursor m/z might not. The precursor m/z in the
converted mzML file will have m/z values from quadrupole isolation windows
instead of accurate m/z values. See also the
\href{https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/fileconversion_waters/}{GNPS documentation}
for more information.

The \code{estimatePrecursorMz()} function estimates/adjusts the reported precursor
m/z of a fragment spectrum using the following approach: in data dependent
acquisition (DDA) mode, the MS instrument will select ions with the highest
intensities in one MS scan for fragmentation. Thus, for each fragment
spectrum, this method identifies in the previous MS1 spectrum the peak with
the highest intensity and an m/z value similar to the fragment spectrum's
reported precursor m/z (given parameters \code{tolerance} and \code{ppm}). This m/z
value is then reported. Since the fragment spectrum's potential MS1 mass
peak is selected based on its intensity, this method should \strong{only be used
for DDA data}.
}
\note{
This approach is applicable only when fragment spectra are obtained through
data-dependent acquisition (DDA), as it assumes that the peak with the
highest intensity within the given isolation m/z window (from the previous
MS1 spectrum) corresponds to the precursor ion.

The spectra in \code{object} have to be ordered by their retention time.

Users of this function should evaluate and compare the estimated precursor
m/z values with the originally reported one and only consider adjusted values
they feel comfortable with.

\examples{

## Load a DDA test data set. For the present data set no large differences
## between the reported and the *actual* precursor m/z are expected.
fl <- system.file("TripleTOF-SWATH", "PestMix1_DDA.mzML", package = "msdata")
s <- Spectra(fl)

pmz <- estimatePrecursorMz(s)

## plot the reported and estimated precursor m/z values against each other
plot(precursorMz(s), pmz)
abline(0, 1)

## They seem highly similar, but are they identical?
identical(precursorMz(s), pmz)
all.equal(precursorMz(s), pmz)

## Plot also the difference of m/z values against the m/z value
plot(precursorMz(s), precursorMz(s) - pmz, xlab = "precursor m/z",
    ylab = "difference reported - estimated precursor m/z")

## we could then replace the reported precursor m/z values
s$precursorMz <- pmz
